# CHANGELOG

<!-- 
Add new items at the end of the relevant section under **Unreleased**.

This project follows semantic versioning. While still in major version `0`,
source-stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between
`0.0.3` and `0.0.4`). If you want to guard against potentially source-breaking
package updates, you can specify your package dependency using
`.upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")` as the requirement.

## [Unreleased]

*No changes yet.*
